<h2 class="nobreak"><i>Foreword</i></h2>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap"><i>T</i>HE aim of this play is to represent the impulse
and the progress of civil liberty in this country
since the commencement of the War for Independence.
The intention is never literal. In spite of a certain
actuality in the presentation of the incidents of “The
Glorious Morning” at Lexington, the play must always
be considered and produced as an abstraction of the
events with which it is concerned.</p>

<p>The events themselves are marked by the great sayings
of our prophets of liberty and of sundry other minds
of genius, all quite arbitrarily selected. Great sayings,
through their immense significance to the popular imagination,
become symbols of the periods which occasioned
them. Great activities may, in the same sense,
be looked upon as abstractions of the periods and movements
which required them and made them possible.</p>

<p>The great activities of the story of American civil liberty
are here treated in a kind of processional dumb
show which amplifies the quotations placed in the mouths
of the two Spokesmen, the Choir of speakers and the
characters in the play. When the dumb show is not executed
in procession, it devolves upon groups which act
collectively as a single individual and, on certain occasions,
speak in unison.</p>

<p>Comment upon the action is supplied by a few lines
which have been written for the roles of the Chronicler
and Freedom and for the Chorus of singers.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>The play demands an almost continual musical accompaniment.
This should be composed upon the
foundation of period songs, particularly those which are
indicated in the text. Also, the various speeches of the
Spokesmen will be enhanced if the composer musically
emphasizes their rhythms with some sort of accompaniment.
In the opinion of the author, the score will be
most effectively scored for brass and wind instruments.
The chorus must be a male chorus. The play will suffer,
always, for the introduction of any woman’s voice except
as indicated in the text.</p>

<p>The action is continuous; its changes of locale and
atmosphere being indicated only by shifting emphases
in the lighting.</p>

<p>The acting presents no difficulty beyond that of securing
actors with good voices who have troubled to
learn how to speak the English language.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><i>Think of the place in which the play is to be produced,
just as it has been adapted from the natural
forest. Think of the curving sleeve of water which
lies along the lowermost edge of the scene, of the rising
slopes and levels which surmount one another so spaciously,
of the trees which close in back and sides.</i></p>

<p><i>Then, into the face of the slope immediately above the
water’s edge and directly in the center, set a simple low
throne and put a conventional lectern before it. Flank this
with two lower seats, even more simple. Build this whole
group as gracefully and as lightly as the best taste of the
best Georgian period dictates and paint it the purest white.</i></p>

<p><i>This done, go to the extreme limits of the front of the
scene and, just at the edge of the trees, erect two pedestals.
These, in height, must a little more than top a man’s
stature. In style and decoration they are as chaste as the
central group. Probably they are finished with an exquisite
cornice and adorned with garlands in low relief, just
brushed with gold. Upon each one of them set a solid, simple
throne, quite like the one you have already put in the
center.</i></p>

<p><i>The Chronicler sits on the central throne. He is already
in his place when the doors of the auditorium are opened
to admit the first spectator. So are the two Drummers who
occupy the low seats on either side of him. So are the two
Spokesmen who sit atop the two pedestals.</i></p>

<p><i>For the Chronicler’s role an actor of fine Anglo-Saxon
type must be engaged, one able to speak English with beautiful
and natural precision. The same is true of the roles
of the two Spokesmen.</i></p>

<p><i>The Chronicler wears buff breeches, a white shirt and a
blue coat which hangs nobly from his shoulders and spreads
over the arms of his seat. His hair, of a natural brown, is
pulled back from his brow and tied with a black velvet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
ribbon. The lectern before him supports a great book. At
the commencement of the play he opens this book and, at
the end, he closes it. From time to time, during the action,
he writes in it, using a large and snowy-white quill pen.</i></p>

<p><i>The Drummers who sit on either side of him are dressed
in scarlet and as alike as two peas, in costume, make up
and cut of hair. Neither one of them has ever any occasion
to speak. Each one of them must devote his attention wholly
to playing upon a great kettledrum which will be provided
for this purpose. The two drums are tuned a diminished
third apart.</i></p>

<p><i>The two Spokesmen will wear the scarlet robes and white
wigs of British justices. They never move during the entire
play.</i></p>

<p><i>All of these five persons, it must be repeated, will be in
their places when the auditorium opens. None of them can
be allowed to move until the auditorium has emptied. They
must think of themselves as parts of the fixed scene.</i></p>

<p><i>Behind them, the slope flattens slightly and this area
will, hereinafter, be described as the “Forestage.” Behind
that, again, comes a second, slighter rise and that is succeeded
by a much more considerable level place. This second
level will hereinafter be spoken of as the “Stage.”</i></p>

<p><i>The stage is set to represent the Common of Lexington
in the year 1775. The road from Cambridge and Boston
enters at the back center and divides, passing the Meeting
House on either side. The Meeting House is erected, full
size, just at the back of the stage and directly in the center,
thus masking this road. A little down on the right (in
these stage directions right and left refer to the hands of
the audience) stands the Old Belfry. Further over to the
right, half buried in the trees, are the old horse sheds. Further
down stage on the right stands the Marrett-Munroe
House, also half buried in foliage, and the Concord Road
leaves the Common as far down stage on the right as the
planting permits. On the left, just a little below the position
occupied on the right by the horse sheds, stands the
Buckman Tavern. Then, all the way down stage left
stands the Parsonage of the Rev. Jonas Clark. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
should be set a little apart from the Common to suggest its
remoteness. A road leads past this in the direction of
Bedford.</i></p>

<p><i>These entrances will hereinafter be referred to as the
Boston, Concord and Bedford Roads respectively. Other
village paths may be supposed to lead on to the Common
at any convenient points.</i></p>

<p><i>When the first member of the audience enters, it is twilight.
He finds the life of the village going on with full realism
of detail except that it is in no wise audible. He is
looking at a soundless vision of the eighteenth day of
April, one hundred and fifty years ago. Villagers are chatting
about the doorway of the Buckman Tavern. They
come in and go out. They wear long coats and smoke long
pipes and drink long drinks. Some of them discuss a newspaper
excitedly. What they are saying cannot be heard, for
they play entirely in dumb show. A century and a half is
too great a time to be bridged easily by sound.</i></p>

<p><i>Silent as the rest a boy guards a flock of a few sheep in
the center of the Common. Young girls, going about pleasure
or business and quite free from any preoccupation with
the serious matters which engross the tavern’s patrons, stop
to chat with him.</i></p>

<p><i>Presently a young farmer drives his cows in from pasture.
Presently other farmers return from the fields, carrying
the crude agricultural implements of their day. Presently
another farmer drives his emptied truck wagon home from
market.</i></p>

<p><i>Presently a traveler on a jaded mare comes up the
Boston Road and halts by the Buckman Tavern. The citizens
gather about him greedily. Greedy, it would seem, for news.
And he gives them news before he has finished his ale and
ridden on down the Bedford Road.</i></p>

<p><i>As the play’s commencement draws near, an old man
comes out of the Meeting House. The children, playing
about the Belfry, run into him and he admonishes them.
Then he rings the bell. At first one cannot be quite sure of
the bell. Then the spell becomes stronger and it does clang
dimly through.</i></p>

<p>In the Book of American Freedom it has been written
that the Town of Lexington, in the County of Middlesex,
in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, shall be
designated as “The Birthplace of American Liberty.”
This, says the book, is a fitting designation because the
events which had their scene in Lexington on the glorious
morning of the nineteenth of April one hundred
and fifty years ago this year did forever mark and set
aside the town to be a symbol of liberty to all free
nations and all free peoples.</p>

took command for the siege of Boston. Then
the mob takes on form and appearance and order

<p>The soul of an event is the vision which God sets before
its hero; its life hangs upon the faith men bring to it.
The heroes of God’s choosing make Him manifest to
man; but the faith of man is a wretched thing. Now
this event fares mournfully, for the army of revolt is more
cruelly driven by the doubts and jealousies of man than
by the winds and snows of winter, and the meaning of
Freedom is forgotten in the fact of hardship. Within

<p>[<i>There is music, suddenly and very bright and as
the light floods the scene, two British soldiers
have run in with regimental colors which conceal
Freedom and Washington and the stair from our
view. Then a gay crowd troops on to the stage and
a double column of grenadiers in scarlet coats.
The soldiers quickly form the three sides of a rectangle
and General Howe and Major Andre ride
into their midst. Ladies are there, richly clad and
elaborately coiffured. Musicians are there with
huge bass viols and sundry eccentric instruments
of the period. When all the crowd are assembled,
General Howe and Major Andre ride down to
the water’s edge to welcome two barges. In one of
them is the English Queen of Beauty and, in the
other, the American Queen of Beauty. Each of
the queens is attended by a bevy of damsels in
Turkish costumes. General Howe leads the English
Queen to her throne. Major Andre performs
the same function for the American Queen. The
damsels follow them and the barges are pulled
away out of sight.</i></p>

<p><i>Immediately the two queens have been enthroned,
twelve knights ride into the scene, dressed in
eighteenth century adaptations of the habiliments
of chivalry. They divide into two parties, the
Knights of the Blended Rose and the Knights of
the Burning Mountain. Each party salutes its
queen and the mock tournament is played out,
terminating in an exchange of pistol fire without
casualties. Then the horses are led off and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
knights and the ladies all join in a brilliant,
stately dance which ends in a picture centering
in the two queens, each one of whom has removed
a slipper from which her particular
knight is drinking wine.</i></p>

sweep them across the scene and they come,
stopping here and there to build their camp fires.

schooners with herds of stock and sheep and
the crowd of emigrants is gaily dressed as any
gang of gipsies, red-shirted men, blue and yellow-skirted
women, bright clothes for the children and
bright blankets. And a great light grows up on

moves and all the while the circuit riders and

great march of labor which is built upon the
theme of “I’ve been working on the Railroad.”
The band has taken it up from the Chorus and
woven it into a minor dirge and into bizarre dissonances
and elaborated it with syncopations and
new themes played upon strange instruments and
sung by the voices of the Chorus so that the whole

magnificent climaxes and subsides again so that the

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
